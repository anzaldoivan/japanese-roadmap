# 🎯 Practical Japanese Learning Roadmap: N5 to N2

## 🎮 **Learning Philosophy: Input-Focused Approach**

### **Why Minimal Writing Works:**
- **Modern communication is digital** - typing is more practical than handwriting
- **Reading comprehension is key** - you'll read much more than you write
- **Recognition over production** - you need to recognize kanji, not write them perfectly
- **Time efficiency** - focus on skills you'll actually use

### **What You'll Focus On:**
- **Reading comprehension** (manga, games, documents)
- **Listening comprehension** (anime, podcasts, conversations)
- **Speaking skills** (conversations, presentations)
- **Typing skills** (digital communication)
- **Basic writing** (just enough for notes and simple messages)

## 🔁 Dynamic Roadmap Update Policy
- This roadmap is updated after every class based on the latest entries in `Japanese_Learning_Progress_Tracker.md` and `Japanese_Learning_Mistakes_Tracker.md`.
- Each update will adjust goals, add targeted drills, and revise JLPT knowledge percentages.
- Focus principle: subconscious verbal fluency over perfect grammar; use what you know.
- Kanji deferred: prioritize speaking, listening, hiragana/katakana first; add kanji gradually later.

---

## 📈 JLPT Knowledge Percentages (Live)

| Level | Grammar | Vocabulary | Listening | Notes |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| N5   | 45%     | 1%        | 5%        | Polite form/particles set/counters pending |
| N4   | 0%      | 0%        | 0%        | Not started |
| N3   | 0%      | 0%        | 0%        | Not started |
| N2   | 0%      | 0%        | 0%        | Not started |

- Vocabulary also tracked towards global target of 4000 words (see below).

---

## 🧠 Method Objective
- Learn the basics of grammar (current phase) and immediately apply them with high-frequency vocabulary.
- Build to 4000 most commonly used words for subconscious fluency.
- Group vocabulary by themes for practical usage; practice with structures already learned.

---

## 📚 Vocabulary Objective: 4000 Most Common Words

### Grouping Strategy (Examples)
- People & daily life: family, work, school
- Food & drink: meals, groceries, restaurants
- Places & movement: home, school, city, transport
- Time & routine: days, times, frequency
- Descriptions: colors, size, feelings
- Actions: core verbs (eat, drink, go, come, see, do, make)

### Daily Workflow
1. Deliver at least 20 new words per session (kana + English + kanji peek).
2. Provide an attached batch file (e.g., `Vocabulary_Batch_XX.md`) with grouped words and drills.
3. Use current grammar to practice (translation, sentence building, te-form chains, negatives/past).
4. Log mistakes to `Japanese_Learning_Mistakes_Tracker.md` and update roadmap percentages.

### Milestones
- 0 → 500 words: survival fluency
- 500 → 1500 words: comfortable daily conversation (N5/N4)
- 1500 → 3000 words: independent interaction (N3)
- 3000 → 4000 words: strong functional fluency (towards N2 speaking)

---

## 🧩 Practice Integration
- All new vocabulary will be woven into sentence patterns already learned (だ/です, は/が/を/に, verbs present/negative/past, te-form basics).
- Exercises include: write romaji for kana + English, build sentences, connect actions with 〜て, form negatives/past, and short Q&A.

*This roadmap focuses on practical skills you'll actually use. Writing practice is minimal and focused on digital communication rather than handwriting.*
